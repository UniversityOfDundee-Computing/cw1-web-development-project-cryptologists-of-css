Process for updating the repository using commits etc. 


1. clone the repository into your hard drive. (We need to do this to make sure we are always working on the same most updated files)
2. open local repository in vsc.
3. create branch make sure branch = iain_1
4. do stuff to your files. 
5. check source control repository = the remote project repo'
5. commit and push.
7. go into GitHub and create pull request.
8. is the base MAIN or DEVELOPMENT and is COMPARE your branch?
9. always change base into development. 
10. assign a reviewer from someone in team.
11. wait for their comments.
12. (we should merge the file even with comments because they can be changed later anyway.)

if you have any ideas, create an ISSUE and submit this, linking it to the project, and assign someone to it either yourself or someone else. 

if you are a receiver add comments to the work submitted, either agreeing or adding suggestions and try demonstrate understanding of what is in there and what needs done. 
we can respond to the comments and close conversation.
