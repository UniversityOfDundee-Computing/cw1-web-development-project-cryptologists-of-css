                        missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. It is possible to

                        further instructions or events. Outside of missions, the player can <a

                    <p>The player may run, jump, or drive vehicles to navigate the game's world. The player uses <a

                        increases as the player commits more crimes. On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the
                        current wanted level, and the higher the level, the greater the response for law enforcement <a
                            href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, police

                    <p>During the story, Tommy meets characters from various gangs. As the player completes missions for
                        different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will
                        recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the
                        player may engage in activities such as a <a

                        purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional
                        hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored. <a

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>In 1986, mobster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Vercetti">Tommy Vercetti</a>
                        (voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Liotta">Ray Liotta</a>) is released from
                        prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence for murder. His boss Sonny Forelli (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sizemore">Tom Sizemore</a>), seeking to establish
                        drug operations in the South, sends Tommy to Vice City to oversee an important drug deal
                        alongside crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fichtner">William Fichtner</a>). However, the
                        deal is ambushed by unknown assailants, with Tommy and Ken barely escaping. Angered upon hearing
                        the news, Sonny orders Tommy to recover the drugs, alongside the money Sonny gave to him, under
                        threat of consequences. Seeking information, Ken points Tommy towards retired army colonel Juan
                        Garcia Cortez (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Davi">Robert Davi</a>), who helped
                        set up the exchange. Expressing regret for the ambush, Cortez promises to find out who
                        masterminded it.</p>
                    <p>While investigating, Tommy meets with several people who offer him help, including music director
                        Kent Paul (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Dyer">Danny Dyer</a>), who maintains
                        connections with the city's criminal underworld; Lance Vance (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Michael_Thomas">Philip Michael Thomas</a>), who
                        aided in the deal and lost his brother in the ambush; Texan business tycoon Avery Carrington (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>), who in return enlists
                        Tommy's help with several deals; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_kingpin">drug
                            kingpin</a> Ricardo Diaz (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guzm%C3%A1n">Luis
                            Guzmán</a>), who employs both Tommy and Lance. Eventually, Cortez begins voicing his
                        suspicions that Diaz organised the ambush. Upon further investigation, Lance discovers this to
                        be true and, against Tommy's advice, tries to kill Diaz, only to get himself captured. After
                        Tommy saves Lance, they invade Diaz's mansion and kill Diaz.</p>
                    <p>With Diaz dead, Tommy takes over his assets and, at Avery's suggestion, works to expand his new
                        criminal empire by forcing businesses to pay him protection money and buying out nearly bankrupt
                        companies to use as fronts for illicit operations. Tommy establishes his own gang to protect his
                        businesses from rivals, and provides assistance to several prominent gang leaders in the hopes
                        they will support his expansion. He helps Cortez flee the city with stolen military equipment.
                        Eventually, Sonny discovers that Tommy has gained complete control over Vice City's drug trade
                        without cutting the Forellis in. Enraged at his independence, Sonny sends mobsters to forcefully
                        collect money from Tommy's businesses. In response, Tommy kills Sonny's men and cuts ties with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Later, learning Sonny is personally coming to Vice City to collect what he believes he is owed,
                        Tommy prepares to pay him tribute with counterfeit money. However, Sonny reveals that he was
                        responsible for Tommy's arrest fifteen years prior, and that Lance has betrayed Tommy and allied
                        himself with the Forellis, having felt inadequate in Tommy's presence since his rise to power. A
                        shootout ensues in Tommy's mansion, during which Tommy prevents the Forellis from stealing his
                        money and kills Lance for his betrayal, before finally killing Sonny. When Ken arrives to a
                        scene of carnage, Tommy quickly reassures him that everything is now fine, as he has finally
                        established himself as the undisputed crime kingpin of Vice City.</p>
