            Full production began in late 2001, as <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III" title="Grand Theft Auto III">Grand Theft Auto III</a> was nearing completion;<a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-16-return">[16]</sup></a> while early development only involved creating <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_model" title="3D models">3D models</a>, executive producer <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Houser" title="Sam Houser">Sam Houser</a> said "it really kicked off at the beginning of 2002" and lasted about nine months.<a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-17-return">[17]</sup></a>
            After the release of the Windows version of <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>, the development team discussed creating a mission pack for the game that would add new weapons, vehicles, and missions.
            Upon further discussion, the team decided to make this concept a stand-alone game, which became </a><em>Vice City</em>.<a href="#footnote-18"><sup id="footnote-18-return">[18]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The game was announced at the <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2002" title="Electronic Entertainment Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> on 22 May 2002.<a href="#footnote-19"><sup id="footnote-19-return">[19]</sup></a>
            It was Rockstar North's most expensive game at the time, with a development budget of US$5 million<a href="#footnote-20"><sup id="footnote-20-return">[20]</sup></a> and marketing budget of US$13.2 million.<a href="#footnote-21"><sup id="footnote-21-return">[21]</sup></a>
            On 5 September 2002, Rockstar announced the release date of 22 October had been postponed until 29 October to meet product demand.<a href="#footnote-22"><sup id="footnote-22-return">[22]</sup></a>
            By 15 October 2002, development of <em>Vice City</em> stopped as the game was <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_to_manufacturing_(RTM)" title="submitted for manufacturing.">submitted for manufacturing.</a><a href="#footnote-23"><sup id="footnote-23-return">[23]</sup></a>

        <h1>Setting</h1>

        <p>
            The game is set in 1986 in fictional Vice City, which is based heavily on the city of <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami" title="Miami.">Miami.</a><a href="#footnote-27"><sup id="footnote-27-return">[27]</sup></a>
            Vice City previously appeared in the original <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game)" title="Grand Theft Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase.<a href="#footnote-28"><sup id="footnote-28-return">[28]</sup></a>
            They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>'s Liberty City.<a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-16-return">[16]</sup></a>
            The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Benzies" title="Leslie Benzies">Leslie Benzies</a> describes as "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath".<a href="#footnote-18"><sup id="footnote-18-return">[18]</sup></a>
            Sam Houser called it "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime ... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time".<a href="#footnote-29"><sup id="footnote-29-return">[29]</sup></a>
            The team intended to make Vice City a "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like "life still goes on" while the character is inside a building.<a href="#footnote-30"><sup id="footnote-30-return">[30]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The game's look, particularly the clothing and vehicles, reflect its 1980s setting.
            Many themes are borrowed from the crime films <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1983_film)" title="Scarface">Scarface</a> (1983) and <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlito%27s_Way" title="Carlito's Way">Carlito's Way</a> (1993),<a href="#footnote-27"><sup id="footnote-27-return">[27]</sup></a> the latter for its characterisation and portrayal of nuanced criminals.
            The television series <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice" title="Miami Vice">Miami Vice</a> (1984–1989) was also a major influence and was regularly watched by the team throughout development.<a href="#footnote-31"><sup id="footnote-31-return">[31]</sup></a>
            Art director Aaron Garbut used the series as a reference point for emulating <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_lighting" title="neon lighting.">neon lighting.</a><a href="#footnote-29"><sup id="footnote-29-return">[29]</sup></a>
            In recreating a 1980s setting, the team found it "relatively painless" due to the distinct culture of the time period and the team's familiarity with the era.[31]
            The art team was provided with large volumes of research, as well as reference photographs taken by other members of the development team.
            The team organised field research trips to Miami shortly after completing the development of <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>, splitting into small teams and observing the streets.<a href="#footnote-31"><sup id="footnote-31-return">[31]</sup></a><a href="#footnote-32"><sup id="footnote-32-return">[32]</sup></a>

        <p>
            The team spent time "solving [the] riddle" of a speaking protagonist, a notable departure from <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>'s <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_protagonist" title="silent protagonist">silent protagonist</a> Claude.<a href="#footnote-34"><sup id="footnote-34-return">[34]</sup></a>
            <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Liotta" title="Ray Liotta">Ray Liotta</a> portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti and described the role as challenging: "You're creating a character that's not there before ... It's so intensive".
            While recording his performance, the team used <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key" title="blue screen">blue screen</a> to allow Liotta to visualise "how it's gonna move".<a href="#footnote-33"><sup id="footnote-33-return">[33]</sup></a>
            The team strove to make the player feel a "real affinity" for Tommy by prioritising the game's narrative.<a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-16-return">[16]</sup></a>
            Dan Houser described Tommy as "strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive".<a href="#footnote-32"><sup id="footnote-32-return">[32]</sup></a>
            Director <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navid_Khonsari" title="Navid Khonsari">Navid Khonsari</a> found Liotta occasionally difficult to work with.<a href="#footnote-35"><sup id="footnote-35-return">[35]</sup></a>
            Sam Houser said, "In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work".<a href="#footnote-36"><sup id="footnote-36-return">[36]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The majority of the game's animations were original, with only a few borrowed from <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>.
            For the characters, the team used <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture" title="motion capture">motion capture</a> and <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion" title="stop motion">stop motion</a> animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements use a combination of both techniques.
            The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, due in part to the variety of models.<a href="#footnote-37"><sup id="footnote-37-return">[37]</sup></a>
            Pedestrian character models use <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(computing)" title="skins">skins</a> in <em>Vice City</em>, allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters.
            There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(computer_graphics)" title="polygons">polygons</a> and <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping" title="textures">textures</a> found in <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>.<a href="#footnote-27"><sup id="footnote-27-return">[27]</sup></a><a href="#footnote-32"><sup id="footnote-32-return">[32]</sup></a>
            The increased polygons also impacted the <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics" title="character physics">character physics</a>, improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy.<a href="#footnote-38"><sup id="footnote-38-return">[38]</sup></a>
            Some character models and storylines were inspired by films such as <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a> (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film" title="action">action</a> television shows of the 1980s.<a href="#footnote-39"><sup id="footnote-39-return">[39]</sup></a>
            The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of <em>Miami Vice</em>'s <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Crockett" title="Sonny Crockett">Sonny Crockett</a> and <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Tubbs" title="Ricardo Tubbs">Ricardo Tubbs</a>.<a href="#footnote-40"><sup id="footnote-40-return">[40]</sup></a>

        <p>
            The game features 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue, four times the amount in <em>Grand Theft Auto III.</em><a href="#footnote-32"><sup id="footnote-32-return">[32]</sup></a>
            It contains over 90 minutes of <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene" title="cutscenes">cutscenes</a> and nine hours of music,<a href="#footnote-32"><sup id="footnote-32-return">[32]</sup></a> with more than 113 songs and commercials.<a href="#footnote-41"><sup id="footnote-41-return">[41]</sup></a>
            The team enjoyed the challenge of creating the game's soundtrack, particularly in contrast to <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>'s music, which Sam Houser described as "clearly satirical and its own thing".<a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-17-return">[17]</sup></a>
            In developing the radio stations, the team wanted to reinforce the game's setting by collating a variety of songs from the 1980s, which required extensive research.<a href="#footnote-42"><sup id="footnote-42-return">[42]</sup></a>
            The radio stations were published by <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records" title="Epic Records">Epic Records</a> in seven albums—known collectively as <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set</em>—alongside the game in October 2002.<a href="#footnote-43"><sup id="footnote-43-return">[43]</sup></a><a href="#footnote-44"><sup id="footnote-44-return">[44]</sup></a>
            <em>Vice City</em> contains about "three times as much" <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio" title="talk radio">talk radio</a> as <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em>.
            Producer and talk show host <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazlow_Jones" title="Lazlow Jones">Lazlow Jones</a> stated that the small percentage of station listeners that actually <a class="strong-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone-in" title="call in">call in</a> are "insane"; in <em>Vice City</em>, the developers "bumped it up a notch", emphasising the extremity.
            Dan Houser felt that the talk stations give depth to the game world.<a href="#footnote-45"><sup id="footnote-45-return">[45]</sup></a>
