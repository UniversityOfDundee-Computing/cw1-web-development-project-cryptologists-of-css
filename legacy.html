        <p> Mike Snider of <em>USA Today</em> wrote that <em>Vice City</em> "raised the bar for video games", citing its interactivity, violence, 
        and soundtrack.<a href="#footnote122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> <em>Kotaku</em>'s Luke Plunkett and PC Magazine's 
        Jeffrey L. Wilson both named </em>Vice City</em> 
        the best game in the series, with the former naming it the "perfect Grand Theft 
        Auto experience".<a href="#footnote123"><sup>[123]</sup></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>
        The readers of Official UK PlayStation Magazine named <em>Vice City</em> the fourth-greatest PlayStation 
        title ever released.<a href="#footnote125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> 
        In 2006 <em>Vice City</em> appeared on Japanese magazine Famitsu's readers' list of top 100 games; it was one of the only Western titles 
        on the list.<a href="#footnote126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> 
        Art director Aaron Garbut felt that, alongside its predecessor <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em> and 
        successor <em>San Andreas</em>, <em>Vice City</em> led the trend of open world games.<a href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
        A new rendition of Vice City is set to return in <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> (2025).<a href="#footnote127"><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

            <em>Double Pack</em> was later bundled with <em>San Andreas</em> in a compilation titled <em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</em>, released 
            in October 2005.<a href="#footnote133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> Analysts believed that the game would eventually release 
            on GameCube,<a href="#footnote134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> though it never materialised.<a href="#footnote135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> <em>The Trilogy</em> 
            was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010.<a href="#footnote136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            For its tenth anniversary in 2012, <em>Vice City</em> was ported to mobile devices by War Drum Studios, building on the Windows version with 
            enhanced visuals and a customisable layout.<a href="#footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> It was released for iOS devices on 6 
            December,<a href="#footnote137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>
            for Android on 12 December following a delay due to technical issues,<a href="#footnote138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> and for Fire OS on 
            15 May 2014.<a href="#footnote139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> An emulated version of <em>Vice City</em> was released on the PlayStation 3

            released for the PlayStation 4 on 5 December 2015, upscaled to 1080p and with support for Trophies.<a href="#footnote141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> A 
            remastered version of The Trilogy, subtitled <em>The Definitive Edition</em>, was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, 
            PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11 November 2021,<a href="#footnote142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> and for Android and iOS on 
            14 December 2023.<a href="#footnote143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> The original game was removed 
            from digital retailers in preparation for <em>The Definitive Edition</em>,<a href="#footnote142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> 
            but later restored as a bundle on the Rockstar Store.<a href="#footnote144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            A core team of six fans reverse-engineered the game and released it as an executable in December 2020, having worked on it since May; 
            titled <em>reVC</em>, the project allows the game to be unofficially ported to platforms such as Nintendo Switch, PlayStation Vita, 
            and Wii U.<a href="#footnote145"><sup>[145]</sup></a><a href="#footnote146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown for the project in 
            February 2021.<a href="#footnote147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> In April, Theo, a New Zealand-based developer who maintained a fork of the source code, 
            filed a counter-notice on GitHub, claiming that the code does not contain any original work owned by Take-Two; per DMCA rules regarding disputes, 
            Theo's content was restored after two weeks.<a href="#footnote148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> On 10 June 2021, the team behind <em>reVC</em> filed a 
            counter-notice; per DMCA rules regarding disputes, the source code was restored after two weeks.<a href="#footnote149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> 
            In September 2021, Take-Two filed a lawsuit in California against the programmers, asserting that the projects constitute 
            copyright infringement.<a href="#footnote150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            A team of Russian modders released an unofficial port of the game to <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>'s engine in January 2025, aiming to address perceived issues 
            with <em>The Definitive Edition</em>.<a href="#footnote151"><sup>[151]</sup></a><a href="#footnote152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> A DMCA complaint by Take-Two resulted in the 
            eletion of the mod's trailer and YouTube channel, though some journalists noted the 2022 decree protecting Russian companies from 
            copyright enforcement by Western firms (as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine) may shield the mod and team from legal action by 
            Take-Two.<a href="#footnote153"><sup>[153]</sup></a><a href="#footnote154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> <em>Vice City</em>'s technical director, Obbe Vermeij, defended Take-Two's 
            decision, opining that the mod "directly competes" with <em>The Definitive Edition</em>, though he acknowledged the takedown "would be easier to swallow if 
            [Rockstar] produced competent re-masters".<a href="#footnote155"><sup>[155]</sup></a>
