Meeting 1 Notes:
• This first meeting took place on Thursday 6th of January, after our Web Application Development Lab at 12:00pm. 
• This first formal meeting was a brainstorming session and we made an update to our roles. 
• Based on the marking criteria, we decided it would make more sense to have someone link all the pages together via a nav bar and that we would all handle an individual page where we would all do CSS and HTML. 

• During the session, Giri sent us 2 fonts that are used for GTA Miami to emulate that global style for the website. 

• And Luyen offered to make a wireframe prototype/mock-up which was sent to us by Sunday. This timeframe was fulfilled.

• We also looked through the examples and the marking criteria. We couldn’t find a good CSS framework that was similar to use for GTA: Vice City. 

To consider for the next meeting: 
• For the next meeting, we have decided that we should meet at Lab 2 (provided there are no classes taking place there) to define the details of our project and roles. 
• We have also not decided on specific schemes like particular colour schemes to keep a global style. 

Next meeting to take place: 1:30pm to 2:00pm at the QMB Lab 2.
