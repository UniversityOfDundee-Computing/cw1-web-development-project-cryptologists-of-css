This meeting took place Thursday 20th February 2025 from 11:00am. 

We organised another drop-in meeting on Tuesday to work on the project and check on progress. 
No set time, but some of us will arrive in the morning. Iain has to leave by 4:00pm. 

• In meeting 3, we checked on the progress of people's pages. 

• Iain tried cloning the Development branch Giri made. 

• Giri made clear that we were to take the first part of the nav bar and put it into our individual html files/our individual page (I think this is from his index file). 

• For instance, I am to take the nav bar from his file and put it into my legacy.html. 

• Also, Giri briefly mentioned to copy and paste the border. 

Method we discussed: 

1) Push to your own branch,
2) Then create a pull request and merge with the Development branch; there should be a place for you to comment,
3) Then, finally pull to the main branch. 

• Note: we can also make changes to the CSS file. 

Commit messages: 
- are meant to be useful and atomic.
- the purpose of the commit should be "well-defined".
- so, don't mention a lot of things; it should be one at a time.
- Giri gave an example of committing an image - e.g. you can mention the styling of an image with commit and image.

• We agreed for Luyeen to make a change to the colour in Giri's CSS - make a commit because Luyen said the white colour of the text was not as readable. 

• Luyen asked about whether our work has to match everything in Giri's CSS file - like the name, id, class. Giri said confirmed -- yes, it needs to match. 

• We suggested for everyone to finish a "skeleton" by Tuesday and keep doing things on Github. 

We also discussed: 
Potentially - 
- Create a project board to assign tasks in the project board and track the progress, so we can mark things as completed. 

Issues: 
Create an issue.

1) Go on issue and create new issues.

2) Choose feature request.

3) Pick an apt title.

5) Leave a comment/description (if you want). 

6) You can assign someone or yourself to the issue (right hand column). 

7) Someone can create sub issues (or you can create sub issues yourself after).


Messages in the WhatsApp can be repeated to communicate more in Github.
