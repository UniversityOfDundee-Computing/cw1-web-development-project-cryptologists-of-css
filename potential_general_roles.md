Potential Roles - discarded (changes have been made and updated in meeting 1 discussion).

Note: according to Femi, everyone must take on some form of a technical role (as in, do some of the code and that will be evidenced by the commits). 

We might need to adjust these roles to distribute work more evenly and account for different pages, for other reasons — so these roles are not yet set in stone or defined. 

There are 5 people in this group, so it was difficult to split these roles into 5, so they may need to be adjusted. The important thing is that everyone commits something. 

Roles — not set in stone yet, but these act as a general guide to how we might define roles. 

Role 1
Project Manager (and Content Developer)
What does the Project Manager do? (must also take on a technical role and actually code)!
Sets up and maintains the Github repo and GitHub Pages, 
Manages branches (main branch, feature branches) and merges pull requests. 
Creates and assigns GitHub Issues and Project Board tasks, 
Ensures everyone commits their work properly, 
Organises and assigns tasks on Github Issues and Project Boards, 
Ensures Proper documentation (in the README, meeting notes, contribution guide). 

Idea for what the Project Manager can also do in terms of code is: 
Content Developer
Only related to the content: will be responsible for extracting and organising the content from the Wikipedia page, 
Building some of the HTML structure for key sections (NOT including styling), 
Ensures proper text formatting, lists, and headings. 

This role should be more coordinator than coding heavy. 
*Some of the admin tasks like merging pull requests can be shared. 



Instead of the Project Manager handling all the content, another member (e.g. the Footer Developer can help by structuring some HTML sections). 

Role 2
Navigation and Header Developer

Responsibilities:
Designs and codes the navigation bar:
Decides what links go in the navigation bar (e.g. Home, About, Contact, specifically GTA: Vice City related), 
Chooses the layout (horizontal, vertical, dropdowns if necessary), 
Ensures that the navigation fits the website’s structure. 
Ensures proper linking between pages, 
Creates a website header (such as a title or logo, etc.), 
This person also works with the styling developer to match the overall design. 
Giri has suggested an 80s style. 



Role 3
Layout and Global Styles Developer
The person defines the overall structure using CSS (like grids, etc.)
They also will create a global stylesheet for colours, fonts and spacing, 
The role also ensures the layout consistency across all pages, 
They work with other developers to integrate their individual sections properly. 



Role 4
Styling and Accessibility Developer
This person will add the visual styling like (the buttons, the links, the images) — this can potentially be shared, 
They ensure that the colours contrast well, that the text and things are readable, 
Adds stuff like hover effects, highlights or animations, 
They will also work with the footer developer to ensure there is a polished look to the site. 



Role 5
Footer (and potentially also the testing developer — but apparently we all need to test? according to Femi?)
Designs and codes the footer (such as bibliography, copyright, any quick links), 
They test the website for any layout issues, any broken links and responsiveness issues, 
Documents the testing results and makes any minor adjustments, 
Works with the Project Manager to ensure the final quality of the site and project.
