        <h1>Critical response</h2>
<p>
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was released to critical acclaim. Metacritic calculated an average score of 95 out of 100, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 62 reviews. It is Metacritic's highest-rated PlayStation 2 game of 2002,[46] and the fifth-highest rated PlayStation 2 game overall, tied with a number of others.[c] Reviewers liked the game's sound and music,[3][8] open-ended gameplay,[47][49] and open world design,[5][48] though some criticism was directed at the controls and technical issues.[9][14] IGN's Douglass Perry declared it "one of the most impressive games of 2002",[49] and GameSpy's Raymond Padilla named the experience "deep, devilishly enjoyable, and unique".[48]
</p>

<p>
Reviewers generally considered the missions an improvement over Grand Theft Auto III, although some noted occasional awkwardness and frustration.[9][48] IGN's Perry wrote that the game's missions give the player "a stronger feeling of being inside a story within a world that truly exists".[49] Game Informer's Matt Helgeson found the missions to be more complex,[47] and AllGame's Scott Alan Marriott felt that the storyline was improved as a result. Marriott also found the lead character of Tommy to be more engaging than Grand Theft Auto III's Claude;[3] IGN's Perry felt that Rockstar "found the right person and the right choice",[49] and Edge wrote that Tommy "sweats charisma", commending Ray Liotta's performance.[14]

Reviewers praised the design and detail of Vice City, noting it felt more alive than Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City.[3][5][48]
</p>

<p>
The game's open world design was praised by reviewers, many of whom felt that it contained more detail and felt more alive than its predecessors.[3][5] GameSpy's Padilla made favourable comparisons between Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City, noting the former's level of detail.[48] Game Revolution's Ben Silverman wrote that the game's depth is "unparalleled", praising the world's realism and detail,[8] while AllGame's Marriott commended the "ambitious scope in design".[3]
</p>
Marriott of AllGame named Vice City an "unforgettable listening experience",[3] and Perry of IGN declared the music as "the most impressive list of songs in a game".[49] Many reviewers commended the game's radio stations and talk radio,[5][9] and felt that the game's collection of licensed 1980s music fit the tone and time period of the world.[8][48] The voice acting also received praise;[47] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann named the cast of characters "colorful and memorable",[9] and IGN's Perry found the voice acting "among one of the best of its kind".[49] Game Revolution's Silverman felt that the acting "gives the story credence".[8]
<p>
Many reviewers found that the game offers a better variety of vehicles than Grand Theft Auto III,[5][47][48] and found them easier to control;[8] GameSpot's Gerstmann named the driving "more exciting and dangerous",[9] and IGN's Perry found the motorcycle's controls pleasing.[49] In addition to the vehicle handling, reviewers noted improvements in the targeting and shooting mechanics, although still recognised issues.[3][8][9][49] Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that "targeting is improved to the point where combat can actually be fun".[47]
</p>
<p>
Some reviewers recognised an improved draw distance over Grand Theft Auto III, although many identified frame rate drops during hardware-intense sequences.[9][48][49] The changes in character models polarised reviews; while GameSpy's Padilla and IGN's Perry noted the improvement in character models,[48][49] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell considered it "maddening to see that character ... models haven't been smartened up at all".[5] The game's artificial intelligence and long load times were frequently criticised in reviews,[5][9][14] and many reviewers noted the awkward camera angles and environment during gameplay.[3][14][47]
Windows version
</p>
<p>
When Vice City was released to Windows in May 2003, it received similar critical acclaim. Metacritic calculated an average score of 94 out of 100, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 30 reviews.[51] It was the highest-rated Windows game on Metacritic in 2003.[56] Reviewers liked the visual enhancements,[11][54] and were generally positive towards the control improvements.[52][53][55]
</p>
<p>
The port's visuals received a positive response from reviewers. AllGame's Mark Hoogland praised the improved car details, environment textures, and weather effects;[52] GameSpot's Greg Kasavin echoed similar remarks, noting occasional frame rate drops.[11] GameSpy's Sal Accardo commended the draw distance improvements, identifying very few texture issues.[54] IGN's Steve Butts found the port's system requirements to be reasonable, unlike Grand Theft Auto III, and praised the faster load times.[55] Eurogamer's Martin Taylor was critical of the visuals, stating that the higher resolutions "aren't kind to the overall visual quality", and criticising the hardware requirements.[53]
</p>
<p>
The control changes of the port were generally well received. Most reviewers found the targeting and shooting mechanics to be improved with mouse and keyboard controls;[11][55] Eurogamer's Taylor called them "far more fluid",[53] and GameSpy's Accardo wrote "there's simply no substitute for aiming with a mouse".[54] However, the driving control changes were widely criticised;[5] IGN's Butts called it "crap".[55] AllGame's Hoogland found the controls to be "more forgiving" over time.[52]

<h1>Mobile Version</h3>
<p>
When Vice City was released on mobile devices in December 2012,[64][65] it received "generally favorable" reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 19 reviews.[57] Reviewers liked the enhanced visuals,[2][58] but criticism was directed at the touchscreen controls.[61][59]
</p>
<p>
The port's visuals were well received. Destructoid's Chris Carter felt that they "[suit] the neon and bright pastel veneer", and wrote that the "new lighting effects and smoothed-out engine really allow the game to pop like it never has before".[58] IGN's Justin Davis praised the updated character models, lighting, and textures,[2] and Touch Arcade's Eric Ford noted that the "visuals are improved but not in a drastic manner".[60] NowGamer found that the mobile display improves the visual enjoyment of the game, despite the issues with the original game.[62] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph identified some issues with character models, but stated "the city looks terrific".[63]
</p>
<p>
Most reviewers criticised the port's touchscreen controls. Pocket Gamer's Mark Brown found them "not ideal", but noted that this was also the case in the original game,[59] while Digital Spy's Scott Nichols felt that the game "only complicated [the controls] further".[61] IGN's Davis was thankful for the addition of customisable controls, and wrote that they "make the experience much more controllable",[2] and Touch Arcade's Ford greatly appreciated the developer's efforts to "make the situation bearable".[60] Destructoid's Carter spoke favourably of the controls, despite noting awkward character movement,[58] while The Telegraph's Hoggins found the controls "far more accomplished" than Grand Theft Auto III's mobile port.[63]
